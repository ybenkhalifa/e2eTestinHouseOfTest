Test Suite Execution in Eclipse
This document provides instructions on how to execute the provided test suite using Eclipse. The test suite is defined in an XML format, and it includes multiple test cases grouped into different categories. You can use Eclipse along with TestNG to run these test cases and analyze the results.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

Eclipse IDE: Download and install Eclipse if you haven't already. You can download Eclipse from https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/.

TestNG Plugin: Ensure that the TestNG plugin is installed in your Eclipse IDE. You can install it via the Eclipse Marketplace by navigating to Help > Eclipse Marketplace and searching for "TestNG."

Java Development Kit (JDK): Make sure you have a compatible JDK installed on your system. Eclipse requires JDK to run Java programs and execute tests.

Project Setup: Ensure that your project containing the test classes and dependencies is configured properly in Eclipse.

Running the Test Suite
Follow these steps to execute the test suite in Eclipse:

Import Your Project: Open Eclipse and import your project containing the test classes if it's not already imported.

Configure TestNG: Ensure that your project is configured with the TestNG library. You can do this by right-clicking on your project, selecting Properties, and then navigating to Java Build Path. Under the Libraries tab, make sure that the TestNG library is listed.

Create a TestNG Suite XML File: If you haven't already created a TestNG suite XML file, you can do so by right-clicking on your project, selecting New > Other, and then choosing TestNG > TestNG Class. Follow the wizard to create a new suite XML file.

Copy the Provided Test Suite XML: Copy the content of the provided test suite XML and paste it into your newly created TestNG suite XML file. Save the file.

Run the Test Suite: Right-click on the TestNG suite XML file you just created, and select Run As > TestNG Suite. This will trigger the execution of the test suite.

View Test Results: Eclipse will execute the test cases defined in the suite. You can view the test results in the "TestNG" tab in the Eclipse console or the TestNG Results view.

Customization
You can customize the test suite by modifying the XML file to include or exclude specific test classes or methods. You can also configure TestNG parameters, listeners, and more within the XML file to suit your testing needs.

After-Suite Actions
The provided test suite includes a reference to an "after-suite.xml" file. You can define post-suite actions in this file, such as generating reports, sending notifications, or cleaning up resources after the entire suite has finished executing.

With this guide, you should be able to run your TestNG test suite in Eclipse and efficiently manage and analyze your test results.
